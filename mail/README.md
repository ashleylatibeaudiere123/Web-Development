## Specification
Tech used: HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript and Django

After signing in, users are redirected to their inbox, where ‘read’ emails appear white and unopened emails appear gray. Clicking on a specific email opens its contents while also allowing users to reply and/or archive an email.

Users can also construct their own emails to be sent to another registered user on the platform. Sent and archived emails are accessible in their respective tabs.
