## Specification
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django

Without signing in, users can freely scan all active listings posted on the website. However, to access more information on each listing as well as other features, users are required to register an account and log in. After signing in, users can create their own listings and view all details on active listings, including the highest bid on the item, description of the item, and comments. Users have the option to join the bidding process, add the item to their watchlist, and post comments on the listing. If a user is viewing their own listing, they can also close the bidding process, which then assigns the user with the highest bid as the winner and notifies them. 

## How to run application

Use: python manage.py runserver
